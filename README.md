# portfolio-filter
An experimental JS web application for filtering cards through multiple methods. Users can filter cards through primary tags, conditional tags that change depending on the selected primary tags, and a search bar that filters the remaining cards by matching text content.

The final version has been optimised and a single-file version has been added for use in WordPress page builders (i.e. HTML widgets).
